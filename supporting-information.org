* Introduction
** Introduction to the SI
This document contains the supporting data for this work. The figures and corresponding codes to generate figures are provided for reproducibility and transparency. All the calculation results of cluster expansion is based on ATAT package from Alex Van de Walle. Because most of the data is generated through ATAT and stored in a tar.gz file, one can reproduce our results by installing ATAT to use our shared raw data. ATAT and relevant documents can be found at
https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/avdw/atat/.

** Guidance for using raw data 

There are several parts of the data that is important to reproduce this work. a) data of basic cluster expansion parameters we developed (ECIs, clusters, structure information). b) Calculation results for vibrational free energy and cluster expansion (ECIs, vibrational free energies). c) The code used in construction of the phase diagram. 

In the first step, basic cluster expansion is stored in a zipped file which can be found in https://github.com/KitchinHUB/kitchingroup-XX. Please download the "CE-novib.tar.gz" in the github. After downloading the file to a directory, you can extract the file in the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
tar -zxvf CE-novib.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

There are two folders in the file which represents the cluster expansion of CuPd bcc and fcc lattice. 

Note that all the POTCAR and OUTCAR files  have been deleted due to license restrictions and to reduce file size. To get further information of the structures, the DFT calculations can be reproduced through ATAT and the vasp.wrap file which contains all the parameter used. Fitting of the cluster expansion does not need any other calculations. The eci.out and clusters.out file contains all the information about the ECIs we use and nbclusters.in is used to reduce several 4-atoms ECIs obtained from MAPS algorithm. The following command will perform the fitting of cluster expansion.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
maps -d
#+END_SRC
 
After the CE is ready, a phase diagram without vibrational free energy can be reproduced by the following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer

#+END_SRC

Note that the -d1 = .../ is the direction of each cluster expansion. -gs1=1 indicates the first phase is the second ground state (L12 structure) in the cluster expansion of CuPd fcc. -gs2=3 indicates second phase is the fourth ground state (CuPd B2 structure) in the cluster expansion of CuPd bcc. The temperature interval is 10 K, the accuracy of the phase boundary is 0.001. The radius of super-cell is 35 $\AA$. -ltep=5e-3 indicates the Low Temperature Expansion (LTE) should be used instead of MC simulation when its accuracy is better than 5
×10^{-3} eV cite:walle-2002-autom-first,walle-2002-alloy-theor. 

The output of phase boundaries is stored in phb01.out file. This file contains data like this

Note that the meaning of six columns above is : Temperature (K), chemical potential, composition of L12 phase (range from -1 to 1), composition of B2 phase (range from -1 to 1), energy of L12 phase and the energy of B2 phase.   

It is clear that at 380 K, the composition of L12 phase has a obvious change (from -0.487 at 370 K to -0.437 at 380 K) which indicates a phase transition from ordered phase to disordered phase. Therefore, L12 structure is replaced with disordered fcc based on following command.

The summarized data of phase diagram is stored in "novib-0-0.5.txt" and "novib-0.5-0.75.txt". First and third columns in those txt files are compositions of Pd on the phase boundaries. Second and fourth columns are lists of temperature corresponding to the composition in the same row. More details about the PHb program can be found in Refs. citenum:walle-2002-self-driven,walle-2002-autom-first. 

In the next step, the vibrational free energy is considered in the cluster expansion. The calculation of the vibrational free energy is based on displacement of the atoms by 0.035 $\AA$ for fcc and 0.02 $\AA$ for bcc. Details of these calculations can be found in stiffness-fcc.tar.gz and stiffness-bcc-tar.gz files. The following commands can be used to extract the files.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
tar -zxvf stiffness-fcc.tar.gz 
tar -zxvf stiffness-bcc.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

All the fitted result of stiffness versus bond length is stored in the slspring.out file in each of the directories and then used to calculate the vibrational free energy. The calculation result and corresponding cluster expansion is stored in CE-vib-fcc.tar.gz and CE-vib-bcc.tar.gz files, which can be extracted as: 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
tar -zxvf CE-vib-fcc.tar.gz 
tar -zxvf CE-vib-bcc.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Vibrational free energy results are kept in all the fvib file in each structure. The following code is used to calculate vibrational free energy.

#+END_SRC

When the CE is ready, users can repeat the previous steps to run the PHb program to create a phase diagram. The calculation result is summaried in a txt file called "dt10-vib.txt" in the same directory as cluster expansion files.  

* Convergence studies
** Convergence of DFT calculation 
*** DFT calculations in cluster expansion
In the cluster expansion, the PBE functional was used to calculate energies of all the structures. Convergence on energy cutoff for various structures in CuPd bcc and fcc lattice was performed. The energy cutoff changes from 350 eV to 600 eV and number of k-points per reciprocal atom is set to be 2000. An energy cutoff of 500 eV is found to be sufficient to convergence of 1 meV/atom. Convergence on density of /k/-points grid was also tested. The number of k-points per reciprocal atom was changed from 1000 to 10000. For structures with 1-8 atoms, 4000 k-points per reciprocal atom is found to be sufficient to converge within 1-2 meV/atom. In cluster expansion, the number of k-points per reciprocal atom is set to be 4000. 

*** Summary of converged energy cutoff and k-points in different functionals (PBE, PBEsol, LDA, AMO5)
In order to reach convergence of 1 meV/atom, we increase energy cutoff and density of /k/-points respectively and the resulting parameters in various functionals are summarized in following tables ref:tag-PBE, ref:tag-PBEsol, ref:tag-AMO5, ref:tag-LDA. Several examples that inlustrates how we performed those calculations can be found in Appendix part.

** Convergence of stiffness of bonds on energy cutoff

Before the fitting of stiffness of stretching and bending force constants as function of bond length, a convergence test is needed to determine preferable parameters for static calculation. 

We generated super-cell structure of B2 with displacement of perturbed atom for four compositions (Cu, Pd, CuPd, Cu5Pd3). The displacement is chosen to be 0.02 $\AA$ and radius of super-cell is set to be 9 $\AA$ which is more than three times the distance between nearest neighbors. The sufficiently large radius is of necessity so as to make sure the element of force constant matrix falls to negligable value at the boundary of super-cell. The isotropic strain of 1% is applied in order to determine the volume dependent of spring constant. Besides, two volumes are sampled which is the minimum requirement to determine the relationship between bond stiffness and bond length cite:walle-2002-alloy-theor.

The energy cutoff increases from 350 to 500 eV and /k/-points grid remains at 7×7×7. After all the calculations, the relationship between stiffness and bond length is determined by least-square fitting. Figure ref:fig-cucu describes the relationship between stiffness and bond length for Cu-Cu bond. As energy cutoff increases, the change of stiffness at various bond length is negligible which indicates the convergence of stiffness at energy cutoff of 350 eV.

Figure ref:fig-cupd is the relationship between stiffness and bond length for Cu-Pd bond. It is clear that larger energy cutoff does not make obvious change to the trend of stiffness versus bond length. In order to reduce the computational cost, energy cutoff is chosen to be 350 eV.

Figure ref:fig-pdpd represent the trend of bond-length-dependent stiffness of Pd-Pd bond as a function of energy cutoff. Although energy cutoff changes from 350 to 500 eV, the change of stiffness for both stretching and bending mode is within 0.02 $eV/{\AA}^2$. Therefore, energy cutoff of 350 eV is sufficient for convergence of stiffness within 0.02 $eV/{\AA}^2$.

** Convergence of bond-length-dependent force constant on density of k-point grid

In this section, we generated super-cell structure of B2 with displacement of perturbed atom for four compositions (Cu, Pd, CuPd, Cu5Pd3) of bcc lattice. The displacement is chosen to be 0.02 $\AA$ and radius of super-cell-is set to be 9 $\AA$ which is more than three times the distance between nearest neighbors. The sufficiently large radius is of necessity so as to make sure the element of force constant matrix falls to negligable value at the boundary of super-cell. The isotropic strain of 1% is applied in order to determine the volume dependent of spring constant. This parameter is important for use of quasi-harmonic approximation to calculate vibrational free energy that accounts for thermal expansion. 

Density of k-points mesh increases from 5×5×5 to 10×10×10 and energy cutoff is fixed to 350 eV. After all the calculation is finished, the stiffness versus bond length is fitted automatically. From the figure ref:fig-cucukpt, it is obvious that density of k-points mesh significantly influences the stiffness of Cu-Cu bond at various bond length and the stiffness will converge to less than 0.1 $eV/{\AA}^2$ when the density of /k/-points mesh is greater than 7×7×7.

[[./images-si/Cu-Cu-testkpts.png]]



Figure ref:fig-cupdkpt represent the trend of bond-length dependent stiffness of Cu-Pd bond. As seen in left plot of figure ref:fig-cupdkpt, stiffness of stretching mode shows very small change as density of k-points grids increases. As for the bending mode, the stiffness of short bond length (shorter than 2.8 $\AA$) does not show significant increase in higher k-points. At longer bond length (longer than 2.8 $\AA$), the change in stiffness is noticeable, but converges at k-points mesh density of 7×7×7.

Figure ref:fig-pdpdkpt shows the bond-length dependent stiffness of Pd-Pd bond. As shown in left plot of figure ref:fig-pdpdkpt, the stiffness of stretching mode of Pd-Pd bond reaches convergence of 0.05 $eV/{\AA^2}$ at k-points mesh density of 7×7×7. On the right plot of figure ref:fig-pdpdkpt, stiffness of bending mode shows small changes when density of k-points grids is larger than 7×7
×7.

In our final result, all the calculations are performed on k-point mesh that is denser than 9×9×9 in order to reach sufficient accuracy. 


** Choice of ISMEAR in calculation of phonon free energy

ISMEAR determines how the partial occupancies are set for each wave function. We used to utilize tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections (ISMEAR=-5). However, according to VASP manual, the only drawback is that the methods is not variational with respect to the partial occupancies, therefore the calculated forces might be wrong by a few percent for metals.  In this section, method of Methfessel-Paxton (ISMEAR=1) is used and the calculation based on energy cutoff of 350 eV and density of k-points mesh of 9×9×9 is reproduced. The result is shown in figure ref:fig-cucuismear, ref:fig-cupdismear and ref:fig-pdpdismear. 

Figure ref:fig-cucuismear shows the obtained trend of stiffness versus bond length. As is shown in the figure ref:fig-cucuismear, the stiffness of Cu-Cu bond turn to positive value at bond length of around 2.9 $\AA$ when method of Methfessel-Paxton, rather than tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections, is utilized. This indicates the error of force calculation is the source of wrong trend of stiffness versus bond length. For the right plot of figure ref:fig-cucuismear, the change in stiffness of bending mode is irregular and negligible.

Figure ref:fig-cupdismear shows the stiffness of Cu-Pd bond as a function of different ISMEAR. When  method of Methfessel-Paxton (ISMEAR=1), rather than tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections (ISMEAR=-5), is utilized, the resulting stiffness is really close to that of tetrahedron method. The result of Cu-Pd bond vibration shows ISMEAR does not make obvious changes to stiffness of Cu-Pd bond, in both bending (the right plot )and stretching mode (the left plot).

Figure ref:fig-pdpdismear is the result of stiffness of Pd-Pd bond versus bond length. As method of Methfessel-Paxton (ISMEAR = 1), rather than tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections (ISMEAR=-5), is utilized, the stiffness of stretching mode of Pd-Pd bond increases a little, as shown in left plot of figure ref:fig-pdpdismear. In comparison, the change of stiffness in bending mode seems random and largest difference is about 0.05 $eV/{\AA}^2$, as shown in the right plot of figure ref:fig-ppdpdismear.

[[./images-si/Pd-Pd-ismear.png]]

In conclusion, method of Methfessel-Pexton is found to be important for a correct value of force. The trend of stiffness will be well above zero as this method is utilized. In our final result, we use ISMEAR = 1 for all the accurate calculations.  

** Convergence of bond-length-dependent force constant on displacement of atom
*** bcc structure

We generated super-cell structures of B2 with displacement of perturbed atom for five compositions (Cu, Pd, CuPd, Cu5Pd3, Cu3Pd). The displacement is chosen from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ and radius of super-cell-is set to be 9 $\AA$ which is more than three times the distance between nearest neighbors. The sufficiently large radius is of necessity so as to make sure the element of force constant matrix falls to negligible value at the boundary of super-cell. The isotropic strain of 1% is applied in order to determine the volume dependent of spring constant. Besides, energy cutoff is 350 eV and k points density is fixed to 10×10×10. After all the calculations are finished, the stiffness versus bond length is fitted. The figure ref:fig-cucudis, ref:fig-cupddis, ref:fig-pdpddis are the relationship between stiffness and bond length for Cu-Cu bond, Cu-Pd bond and Pd-Pd bond respectively. 


As for stretching mode of Cu-Cu bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not change the stiffness, as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-cucudis. Comparably, right panel of figure ref:fig-cucudis indicates the stiffness of bending mode is influenced by various displacements of atom. However, the dependence on displacement of atom is irregular and changes of stiffness is within 0.04 $eV/{\AA^2}$. Also most of points are below zero which is not quiet reasonable. The reason behind this observation is not yet known, but based on convergence of stiffness in stretching mode, we can conclude that displacement from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not apparently change the stiffness of bond and therefore, the vibration mode of system is harmonic with appropriate displacement of atom.

As for stretching mode of Cu-Pd bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not change the stiffness, as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-cupddis. Comparably, right panel of figure ref:fig-cupddis indicates the stiffness of bending mode does not depend on displacement of atom. Also most of points are below zero which is not quiet reasonable. Based on convergence of stiffness in stretching mode, we can conclude that displacement from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not apparently change the stiffness of Cu-Pd bond and therefore, the displacement of atom within this range will lead to a harmonic vibration.

As for stretching mode of Pd-Pd bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not change the stiffness, as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-pdpddis. Comparably, right panel of figure ref:fig-pdpddis indicates the stiffness of bending mode shows no dependence on displacement of atom at short bond length (< 2.9 $\AA$). As bond length increases, the dependence of displacement of atom is not significant and changes of stiffness is within 0.05 $eV/{\AA}^2$. Another important feature of right part of figure ref:fig-pdpddis is that most of points are below zero which is not quiet reasonable. The reason behind this observation is not yet known, but based on convergence of stiffness in stretching mode, we can conclude that displacement from 0.005 to 0.04 $\AA$ does not apparently change the stiffness of Pd-Pd bond and therefore, the displacement of atom within this range will result in harmonic vibration.

*** fcc structure

We generate super-cell structure of fcc with displacement of perturbed atom for four compositions (Cu, Pd, Cu3Pd, CuPd3). The displacement is chosen from 0.02 to 0.2 $\AA$ and radius of super-cell-is set to be 8.4 $\AA$ which is more than three times the distance between nearest neighbors. The sufficiently large radius is of necessity so as to make sure the element of force constant matrix falls to negligible value at the boundary of super-cell. The isotropic strain of 1% is applied in order to determine the volume dependent of spring constant. This parameter is important for use of quasi-harmonic approximation to calculate vibrational free energy that accounts for thermal expansion. Besides, two volumes are sampled which is the minimum requirement to determine the relationship between bond stiffness and bond length. Besides.energy cutoff is 350 eV and /k/-points density is fixed to 9×9×9. After all the calculations are finished, the stiffness versus bond length is fitted. The figure ref:fig-cucudis-fcc, ref:fig-cupddis-fcc, ref:fig-pdpddis-fcc are the relationship between stiffness and bond length for Cu-Cu bond, Cu-Pd bond and Pd-Pd bond respectively.

[[./images-si/Cu-Cu-fcctestradius.png]]


As for stretching mode of Cu-Cu bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.02 to 0.2 $\AA$ cause a small disparity of stiffness (less than 0.05 $eV/{\AA}^2$), as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-cucudis-fcc. The stiffness does not seems converge as displacement decreases from 0.035 to 0.02 $\AA$. The resulting stiffnesses of displacement of 0.035 and 0.05 $\AA$ are quiet consistent with each other. Therefore, the only conclusion we can reach is that stiffness converges to 0.04 $eV/{\AA}^2$ at displacement of 0.035 $\AA$. Comparably, right panel of figure ref:fig-cucudis-fcc indicates the stiffness of bending mode is influenced by various displacements of atom. However, most of points are so approaching to zero that their value can be negligible compared with stretching mode. Therefore, we ignore the bending mode and care about stretching term of stiffness.

[[./images-si/Cu-Pd-fcctestradius.png]]


As for stretching mode of Cu-Pd bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.02 to 0.05 $\AA$ cause negligible disparity of stiffness, as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-cupddis-fcc. Therefore, displacement of 0.035 $\AA$ is appropriate for further calculation. For the bending mode in right part of figure ref:fig-cupddis-fcc, all the values are negative and we ignore their contribution to vibrational free energy.

As for stretching mode of Pd-Pd bond, increasing displacement of atom from 0.02 to 0.05 $\AA$ does not change the stiffness, as shown in left panel of figure ref:fig-pdpddis-fcc. The result indicates a convergence of stiffness as displacement is lower than 0.05 $\AA$. Comparably, right panel of figure ref:fig-pdpddis-fcc also indicates the displacement lower than 0.05 $\AA$ can result in convergence of stiffness of bending mode.

** Convergence of bond-length-dependent force constant on super-cell radius

Super-cell size is very important for correct bond-length-dependent force constant. Because sufficiently large radius is able to make sure the element of force constant matrix falls to negligible value a the boundary of super-cell cite:alfe-2009-phon. The recommended super-cell radius is 3-4 times nearest neighbor distance cite:walle-2002-alloy-theor. There we test force constant with super-cell radius of 7 and 8.4 $\AA$. The displacement of atom is 0.035 $\AA$ and structures considered are Cu fcc, Pd fcc, \ce{Cu3Pd} L1_{2} and \ce{CuPd3} L1_{2} structure. Converged energy cutoff is 350 eV and converged density of /k/-point mesh is 9×9×9-10×10×10. 
Method of Methfessel-Paxton (ISMEAR=1) is used for all the calculations. From the left panel of figure ref:fig-cucu-er, ref:fig-cupd-er and ref:fig-pdpd-er below, it is very clear that the resulting stretching term of force constant at a super-cell radius of 8.4 $\AA$ is very close to that at super-cell radius of 7 $\AA$. The bending terms of vibration in right panel of figure ref:fig-cucu-er, ref:fig-cupd-er and ref:fig-pdpd-er also show no obvious change as super-cell radius enlarges. Therefore, the super-cell radius of 7-8.4 $\AA$ is sufficient to obtain accurate force constant.

** Convergence of phase boundary on temperature interval 
Figure ref:fig-dt-vib and figure ref:fig-dt-novib are the result of temperature interval convergence of phase diagram. The temperature interval changes from 25 K to 5 K per step. The thermal expansion is 1% and super-cell radius is 35 $\AA$. It is clear that in both diagrams, the phase boundaries converge as temperature interval is smaller than 25 K.

** Convergence of phase boundary on various super-cell size
  
Super-cell radius is evaluated to ensure the current super-cell size converge. Meanwhile, temperature interval is 10 K per step and other parameters are equal.  As is shown in figure label:fig-cell, as super-cell radius increases from 35 to 50 $\AA$, the main feature of phase boundary does not change and order-disorder transition temperature only shift around 10K. Therefore, it is convincing that phase boundary converges at super-cell radius of 35 $\AA$.

* How to choose phases considered in phase diagram

The convex hull for both CuPd fcc and bcc lattice is compared in figure ref:fig-compare-ce. 
#+attr_latex: :placement [H]
#+caption: Ground state convex hull of CuPd bcc and fcc lattice. The blue dash line indicates the phase right on the line can be as stable as mixture of L12 phase and B2 phase. label:fig-compare-ce 
[[./images-si/CuPd-convexhull-compare.png]]

As shown in Figure ref:fig-compare-ce, the formation energy of \ce{Cu5Pd3} A1 structure is right on the line between L12 structure and CuPd B2 structure. This indicates the \ce{Cu5Pd3} A1 structure is no more stable than the mixture of L12 structure and \ce{CuPd} B2 structure in 0 K. In previous literature cite:subramanian-1991-cu-pd-pallad,teeriniemi-2015-first-princ, disordered A1 phase only exists at temperature higher than 870 K. At lower temperature, L12 phase and B2 phase coexists. Therefore, we neglect the \ce{Cu5Pd3} A1 phase at 0K and only compute the phase equilibrium between L12 and B2 structures in Cu-rich region at low temperature.    

* Stretching and bending mode of force constant
In this section, a complete data of stiffness versus bond length is represented for both streching and bending mode of vibration. 
#+attr_latex: :placement [H]
#+caption:Nearest neighbor stretching and bending force constants versus bond length in bcc and fcc Cu-Pd system (Left three figures are in bcc lattice and three figures on the right are in fcc lattice). label:fig-main
[[./images-si/main-fit.png]]

Figure ref:fig-main shows stretching constants decrease monotonically with increasing bond length in both fcc and bcc lattice. Comparably, bending terms, by contrast, are relatively insensitive and magnitude is much lower than that of stretching term. In this case, only stretching constants are considered in our calculation of vibrational free energy. 

* Effect of thermal expansion on phase diagram

Thermal expansion is considered in calculation of vibration free energy. The vibration free energies of both CuPd fcc and B2 phases are calculated at 0%, 1% and 2% volume increase. Super-cell radius is chosen to be 35 $\AA$ and temperature interval is 10 K per step. As is shown in figure ref:fig-thermal, the thermal expansion has apparent influence on phase boundary at high temperature. large thermal expansion seems cause decreasing in order-disorder transition temperature and reduce the region of B2 phase. It indicates thermal expansion add up to the instability of B2 phase. This phenomenon can be explained by the changes of vibrational entropy due to the anharmonicity resulted from volume effect cite:van-2002-effec-lattic. On the other hand, as thermal expansion is considered, stiffness of all bonds decreases as volume expands which may cause instability of bcc lattice as the stiffness of longer bond approaching to zero. Although thermal expansion cause noticeable change to phase diagram, this change in B2 region is still insufficient to reproduce the experimental phase diagram. But it is also important to note that volume expansion set in out calculation may be different from that in real world and it may be too difficult to evaluate its true effect unless the experimental data of thermal expansion is obtained.

* Effect of different functionals on ground state energy

Different functionals may influence the energy of ground state structures. Calculations based on various functionals were performed on most of the known ground state structures. For bcc, the structures are: \ce{Cu}, \ce{Cu6Pd2}, \ce{Cu5Pd3}, \ce{CuPd}, \ce{Pd}. As for fcc, structures are: \ce{Cu}, \ce{Cu3Pd}, \ce{Cu5Pd3}, \ce{Cu4Pd4}, \ce{Cu3Pd5}, \ce{CuPd3} and \ce{Pd}. 

#+caption: Left panel a shows the heat of formation of all ground state (gs) structures in different functionals. For each point, the x value is the heat of formation for each ground states using PBE functional. Each y value is the heat of formation for the same structure using PBEsol, AMO5 and LDA functionals. The blue line is the parity line comparing the results from various functionals. Middle panel shows the convex hull of fcc lattice utilizing various functionals. The right panel shows the convex hull of bcc lattice using various functionals. label:fig-var-func
#+attr_latex: :placement [H] 
[[./images-si/different-functional.png]]

Figure ref:fig-var-func shows the influence of functional choice on heat of formation of the same ground state structures. All the calculations converge to 1 meV/atom with high energy cutoff and density of /k/-points grid. The middle panel shows that the heat of formation increases as the functional changes from PBE to LDA. The right panel shows similar trend which indicates the energy differences between the most stable structure of CuPd bcc and fcc will change through various functionals. In this case, construction of cluster expansion based on various functionals may have significant change to the order-disorder transition temperature and stability of CuPd bcc lattice.   

* Effect of error in DFT calculation on phase diagram


In order to evaluate whether energetic error of 1-2 meV/atom matters in phase boundary, we manually decrease energy of CuPd B2 ground state structure by 1-3 meV/atom. The resulting phase diagram is summarized in Figure ref:fig-b2. 
#+attr_latex: :placement [H]
#+caption: Effect of error in DFT calculation on transition temperature.   label:fig-b2  
[[./images-si/changeb2.png]]

As is shown in figure ref:fig-b2, the order-disorder transition temperature increases by 5-15 K since the CuPd B2 energy decreases by 1-3 meV/atom. Meanwhile, as energy of B2 phase is reduced, the B2 region remains its shape.

Therefore, it is evident that error in DFT energy does not significantly change the region of B2 phase.
